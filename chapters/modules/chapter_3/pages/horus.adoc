https://nethermind.io/horus/[Horus] is an https://github.com/NethermindEth/horus-checker[open-source] formal verification tool to formally verify your Starknet smart contracts. It provides a user-friendly way to formally verify Starknet smart contracts with respect to specifications written in a simple assertion language. Horus employs various Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers to ensure that your contractâ€™s implementation meets these specifications. The Horus alpha release supports Cairo 0.10.1, with a Cairo 1.0 release coming soon.
